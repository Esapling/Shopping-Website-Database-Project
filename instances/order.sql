CREATE TABLE PURCHASE_ORDER(

    customer_id INT REFERENCES customer (customer_id)

        ON UPDATE CASCADE,

-- while adding a new customer first add the customer to the related table 
-- then add the order info 
-- consider possible error, for that need a trigger to check if the given customer exists
-- but customer table does not keep the registered customers
-- it only depends of the ordered orders
-- so its natural to create (if not exists) a record in the customer table and then in the order table
