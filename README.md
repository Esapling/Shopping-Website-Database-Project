3. Install a virtual environment with name venv: `python -m venv venv --or python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment: 
        `source venv/bin/activate`, on linux machines
        `venv/bin/activate`, on Windows machines
5. Set your python interpreter as in the venv file :
        `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> select python interpreter -> `./venv/bin/python`
